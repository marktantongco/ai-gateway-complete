`grokbuild-proxy` is a local, self-hosted compatibility proxy for using an
operator-owned Grok Build account with Anthropic Messages and OpenAI-compatible
clients.

It translates Claude Code requests to the Grok Build Responses backend,
including SSE, client tools, structured output, reasoning effort, CPA-style
thinking blocks, encrypted reasoning replay, and Grok-hosted web search.

## Features

- Anthropic-compatible `POST /v1/messages`
- OpenAI-compatible Responses, Chat Completions, and Models endpoints
- Incremental SSE translation
- Client function tools and parallel calls
- Anthropic hosted web search mapped to Grok `web_search`
- JSON Schema output mapped to Responses `text.format`
- Adaptive/manual reasoning-effort compatibility
- Summarized/omitted thinking and encrypted reasoning replay
- Multi-account selection, sticky sessions, cooldown, and failover
- Grok CLI import and browser OAuth device login
- Multi-file Grok/CPA JSON and optional SSO batch import with per-item results
- Global and per-credential HTTP(S)/SOCKS proxy routing
- Conservative credential inspection, quarantine, and optional delayed cleanup
- Grok Build shared-weekly-quota view with raw billing diagnostics
- Atomic local JSON storage with locking and backup recovery
- Embedded Admin Web UI
- Health, readiness, Prometheus metrics, request IDs, and structured logs
- Multi-platform archives, checksums, SBOMs, and GHCR images

## One-command installation

Linux / macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreyGunG/grokbuild-proxy/main/scripts/install.sh \
  | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreyGunG/grokbuild-proxy/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installers detect the OS/architecture, download the latest Release, verify
SHA-256, install the binary, and create a local configuration. Set
`GROKBUILD_VERSION=v0.2.0` to pin a release.

## Run from source

Requirements: Go 1.26.5 or newer, or Docker.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GreyGunG/grokbuild-proxy.git
cd grokbuild-proxy
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
go run ./cmd/grokbuild-proxy
```

The proxy listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`. Empty bootstrap keys are generated in
`data/meta.json`.

```bash
jq -r .api_key data/meta.json
jq -r .admin_key data/meta.json
```

Admin UI:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin
```

Complete browser device login in the Admin UI. Prefer this over importing a
potentially stale `~/.grok/auth.json` refresh-token snapshot.

## Claude Code

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="$(jq -r .api_key data/meta.json)"
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=grok-4.5

claude --effort high
```

Configured Claude aliases can also be mapped to Grok models.

## OpenAI-compatible clients

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY="$(jq -r .api_key data/meta.json)"
```

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"grok-4.5","input":"Reply with exactly: ok"}'
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose exec grokbuild-proxy sh -c 'cat /app/data/meta.json'
```

Published image:

```text
ghcr.io/greygung/grokbuild-proxy
```

### Optional SSO import sidecar

The SSO converter is disabled by default. Generate one Bearer token, use the
same value for `SSO_CONVERTER_API_TOKEN` and `sso_converter.api_key`, set the
endpoint to `http://sso-import:8090`, then start the profile:

```bash
export SSO_CONVERTER_API_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
docker compose --profile sso-import up --build -d
```

That command is for a source checkout. Binary release archives also contain an
image-only Compose file, so GHCR users can run the same profile without Go,
Python, or a local image build:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
export SSO_CONVERTER_API_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export GROKBUILD_CONTAINER_TAG=0.1.1
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml --profile sso-import pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml --profile sso-import up -d
```

Release Compose requires one explicit exact `GROKBUILD_CONTAINER_TAG` for both
images, preventing proxy/sidecar version skew from independently moving tags.
The published images are `ghcr.io/greygung/grokbuild-proxy` and
`ghcr.io/greygung/grokbuild-proxy-sso-import`.

Plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback/private addresses or a single-label
Compose service name. The sidecar publishes no host port and validates every
x.ai redirect before following it. SSO values remain in memory and are never
returned to the browser or written by service mode.

Connections from the proxy to a loopback/private/single-label converter are
forced direct, so global HTTP proxies never receive raw SSO values or the
sidecar Bearer key. The sidecar's x.ai egress proxy is configured separately.

`max_batch` is capped at 100 and `timeout_sec` at 300 seconds. The proxy never
follows redirects returned by the sidecar, so neither SSO cookies nor its
Bearer key can be replayed to another URL.

## Known limitations

- Anthropic `count_tokens` is not implemented.
- Thinking signatures are proxy-scoped and account/model-bound.
- Some Anthropic reasoning controls are approximated.
- `top_k` and `stop_sequences` are not forwarded to Grok reasoning models.
- Rich Anthropic hosted-tool result/citation blocks are reduced.
- Only hosted web search has a dedicated Anthropic server-tool mapping.
- OAuth refresh is request-driven, not scheduled in the background.
- The upstream CLI protocol is unstable and may change.
- This is a trusted-operator tool, not a multi-tenant service.

See [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) for details.
